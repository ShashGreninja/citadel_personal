A basic tower defense game coded in C, making use of the raylib library; which is a multi- award winning game development library created by Mr. Raymond Encarnacion, credits to him.

This project is our group P31's attempt at our B.Tech CS First Year final project. We have made free use of standard C libraries as well as the raylib library for the same. We have implemented 
waves of tanks which need to be destroyed by the player before they reach the final outpost using various ammunition they can purchase and place in due course of the game.
